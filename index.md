## Journey
### Early Life
I grew up around computers â€” literally. My dad owned an internet cafe (they were a big deal back then), so I had early access to technology and spent a lot of time exploring different programs, games, and online tools. Despite being surrounded by computers, I didnâ€™t initially consider a career in tech. Like many others, I had my sights set on different paths.

It wasnâ€™t until the COVID-19 lockdown that I seriously started exploring software development. With extra time on my hands, I decided to learn Python as a new skill and that changed everything. What started as casual curiosity quickly became a deep interest in building digital solutions. That period marked the turning point where I began seeing software development not just as a skill, but as a potential career and a way to make a meaningful impact.

### Education and Career
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Software Engineering with Multimedia at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology in Botswana, having started in 2022. My academic experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, computer science principles, and multimedia design.

Alongside my studies, I've taken several professional courses including:
- **MITx: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science**
- **Google Cloud: Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Responsible AI**
- **Africa Code Academy Engineer Residency Program** 

### Goals
- Cement my engineering foundation through a hands-on, startup-like team environment.
- Master industry tools: React, TDD, CI/CD workflows, and team-driven delivery.
- Build a launchpad for impactful software solutions rooted in African contexts.

## Projects
### Project 1: **Digital Tax Mapping System for Kenema Municipality**
While working as a GIS Consultant for the West African Rice Company, We developed a spatial mapping solution to support a digital taxation system in Kenema, Sierra Leone. 

### Project 2: **React TypeScript Quiz App**
Developed an interactive quiz application using **React** and **TypeScript**, complete with:
- Dynamic question rendering
- Score tracking logic
- Integration of software development concepts like GitHub, CI/CD, and TypeScript best practices
- Component-based architecture and clean UI using **Lucide icons** and **TailwindCSS**
